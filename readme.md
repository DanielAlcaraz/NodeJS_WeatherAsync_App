#WeatherApp

This is a simple web app that show in real time the weather of your location using the googlemaps API and a weather API. 

##2 Versions

I create 2 versions, the first called ```app.js```, uses the NPM libraries:    [yargs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs) for the console and the [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) to connecto to the API of GoogleMaps & DarkSky. The second version ```app-promise.js``` use promises and the NPM libraries [yargs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs) and [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).

##Tu run

To run this app at the momento launch the `app.js` with your console. It's show an Address and his latitude and longitude.

Insert in the console `node app.js --help` to see all the commands.
- `--address`: Insert your Postal Code and show the latitude & longitude of your location. Also you can especify the street, country... 

##Example

Write in to the console: ```Î» node app.js -a PostalCode```

It show this result.
```
